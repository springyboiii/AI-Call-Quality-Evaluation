Hello? Here's a man. Hello? Here's a man. Yes, Hi, sir. And hello, I called the... That's a lot to go. Yeah, sorry. We just came back. Sorry about that. Oh, really? I don't know. Yeah, sorry, we taste your corn and then it just connects. Sorry about that. Oh really? I don't have a sword now. I got the chalacious now. Okay. Well, at least we got each other right here right now. Listen, you're dead. As I was told by my finance team, they looked into this. Now, I personally do with atomic, but I should be honest, I never cashed out. I stocked by a monster all in atomic. Can I remove anything out of atomic? Right? Let's put a disc lane. So my knowledge, personal knowledge, maybe limited. But I'm checking everything up with my finance team and they're telling me that the taxes are included in this money. So the taxes are included in this particular amount of cash that they're asking of you. Now, how are they planning to refund it? I have no idea. Right? That's something that I must not explain. But the money that is supposed to be coming in, who your account and most likely the next step will be to ask you for the payment details, I suppose. Like where is the money going to be sending to? The money will be coming in from an account that is not related to crypto. That is the reason how they justify. And they say, that's how you don't pay taxes after the money comes in to your account. You understand? Because the transfer has nothing to do with crypto currency. The cash health itself, if you understand what I mean. Yeah, so what I don't understand, Benjamin, is what we are doing. Well, personal, my next question is, is the envy transfer back to index as we planned? Like it says? Yes. And then convert it. Well, this is something that has to be done with atomic support. I suppose it is possible. I've seen a reason why it wouldn't be possible. But if you can shoot them, I'm not interested in having this transferred to the dollar. Canadian, I'm going to transfer it over to index by myself. But whether that's possible, like you already read it. So that kind of a message. Yes, they are. Because of in terms of taxes, when you get it back to index, when you do it on our account, you put it in a special account. And you must say, whatever we have invested, we don't have to pay taxes. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Just to correct you over there. Okay? Any money coming in, the dollar can aid in, from index, right? In fact, there is no debate about it. Okay, the question is from what type of account or from what business is the money coming in? And then that being one of Canada's largest cryptocurrency case here, that money will be taxable at some point. Do you understand? Yes, it will be okay. 100%. There is no debate about it. Why do we even $100? It's taxable. Do you understand? Okay, there is no debate about it. And given that you have, that you're withdrawing, reported what you've invested, right, you will have taxes. There is no question about it. Now, what atomic as I was explained over here about my finances, what atomic is offering, I mean, it's not clearly explained. So let's put it this way. I have to give you a disclaimer. It's a speculation, right? A very educated speculation, let's put it this way. It can be clarified very much, I guess, in a future couple of messages. But one of my guess is that it's going to be a Canada transfer from their account to your account. Their account that they will use will not have any kind of relations to cryptocurrency whatsoever. There goes the transfer that they're doing to you will be not taxable. Now, how are they going to justify giving you this feedback? I have no idea, to be honest. This is not what they might need to understand. I really don't clarify because in the free show that they're sending, they mention that it is responsible. Yeah, and if it's taxes, so that must be a Canadian company then they're right because they don't know. It is a Canadian company, no. At atomic, atomic. Where is what's founded is the Italian isponina. So, atomic is coming from a Baltic country. I don't know if you've ever heard about it, Estonia. You probably did, right? Yeah. So it's a Baltic country. Obviously, atomic having dead borders in Italian isponina, a compliance with the European Union financial laws and regulations. So, I mean, I don't know if that applies to their breads. Canada, very much. I'm not quite sure about it. I really don't know. But I'm guessing that there are some rules and regulations. Let's put it this way. I have had my clients withdraw a lot of money from us. Some of these clients have passed out their accounts and we haven't spoken about it afterwards. Some of them have some money left because it's continued working. Nobody has ever been complaining. Nobody, nobody has ever had any sort of situation in which they haven't gotten their money. As I mentioned, atomic wallet as a crypto company is way larger than ours. I mean, facilitating a couple of hundreds of thousands dollar withdrawal will probably even have a few million dollars is a piece of cake for them. The way I see it. Crypto transactions are public. So, let's say, for example, when my client puts the money in atomic and like, today, you use it for staking. Staking is investing. Your cryptocurrency for a certain period of time. It's called staking. When they do that, their money goes into some atomic wallet facilities, meaning their own wallets. These wallets are of course possible to be checked to see the balances and what kind of amount of money is moved over there. I can tell you it's a decade volume. It's about $650 million on a 24-hour basis. They're massive. They're super big. So, from that kind of a perspective on the information that I can gather at what I've seen with my own eyes, I can kind of personally vouch atomic solidagem at these and of course, their facilities which are unprecedented. Now, how are you going to guys approach this? Of course, I need to use, of course. Let's put it this way. You might what you're thinking, what do I think? If you can skip the middle moment, which in this case would be the end act. And get your mind straight into a can of the bank account. I take it. And not to mention that there is on everything you get attached to. It's the most beautiful deal you could wish for in my opinion. I mean, I said, you will approach this or where will you see it? But, you know, it would be my kind of personal input. I'm thinking with you now, not in the capacity as an account manager. This would be like, I'm in Geneva, Switzerland simply because I don't want to pay government, you know, 40% of my money. So, you know, I may have a little bit of a bias competing on taxes. I'm not kind of like a boy scout, a good guy when he comes to taxes. I will take advantage of every sport that I can get my hand on. I'm thinking because I consider this to be a, I should say, a kind of a little bit of a TV. But that's a thing. Let's put it this way. I don't want to impose my will on you. That's my opinion. Yeah. So, it comes to taxes and expenses of moving money or cashing out my investments. And I'm coming from your head of state. You know, in there, they would see you alive. And God forbid you get sick here. You're done for. You can basically go bankrupt, you know. And so, I don't know, I have a certain perspective on the matter. And I'm okay to share that as perspective. But of course, like I said, I don't expect you to have my perspective. So, Benjamin, would it hurt to ask him if we can go and send it forward to Maddox and the money would be enough? And I mean, the money would be enough if we put in there. Yeah, of course. That was my original suggestion. The bad thing to be, of course, to treat them a message and tell them, would it be possible to get it done like this. But if we couldn't have you a problem, I mean, and then you send me a free flow later on, if you can ask another side question or two regarding how do they plan to justify this fee return? And whether that fee includes taxes as well. But you don't have to if you don't want to. Yeah, no, no, no, good points. No, no, good points. Yeah. Because if it does, then you've got yourself the best deal there is. So, in other words, what you're saying that extra fee, you're almost $27,000 would be including income tax. Canadian income tax, is that what you're saying? So, if you're paying income tax, capital gains tax, capital would have income tax only if you are licensed and registered day traders. Meaning you do this for a living. Yeah, what's that? Capital gains tax does not mean, it's only some dishes to watch you guys are new. You guys are not day traders. That's important for emphasize. So, day traders will have income tax, right? Because this is their job. This is their profession. This is what they do for a living. Capital gains tax is a simple sale of de-office. You understand? CLA does not have any sort of information what you do with your fading account with all real growth. You understand? There is no information about it. They only see transfer the certain amount of crypto and that you've got tax of certain amount of crypto. Which is initially, let's say for example, like you did without that, right? You've got a certain amount of Bitcoin, you transferred it over to some wallet. They don't know what China conversion has to be done. Did you buy Bitcoin? Bitcoin cash, Ethereum? Did you buy Clonna? Did you buy Cardano? Did you buy some altcoins that is like, way below one cent? Because people do that all the time. But it's just for me to clarify probably a tonics perspective. In a tonics you notice hundreds, it's probably not thousands of coins available over there. Make sure you have coins on a tonics are way below a set. Which means let's say for about a thousand dollars, you would get let's say 25 million or even 25 billion of these coins. And if you move one of them, right? Lives as to let's say half a dollar or a dollar, people will end up making for a thousand bucks. Probably a couple of hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Now, of course, this is borderline gambling. But when we're talking about tax limitation of expenses and especially in crypto, this is how you justify it. Especially when we're doing crypto trading. There's no capital or pensioners on the spender for me. So if there's a capital that tax, we're going to ask them, I think. But that will be copies of gaining taxes and then who will do it? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Who would keep the company? No, no. What is it? As for the message that they've sent, you would get that back. I mean, I am testing that they would take some money out of the transportation of the transfer. These things usually go without saying, but if you can get away with, I don't know, let's say $69,000 in America plus the 20s, whatever they're asking in Canada dollars, I'm not quite sure. But let's say it all rounds up to what? About $160,000 in 18 years. And let's say you get back $110,000, I would feel sensitive to be on an amazing deal. So in order to break you down, ask them for the option of transferring your taxes to a transaction that you do everything on your own and you're handling everything on your own, even when taxes come into place. And then enter a transaction and an index, they don't charge that extra fee or you don't know. You have a fee? You have a fee? Yes, they're not. You have a fee. You have a fee for the transfer, but they are not dealing with taxes. They have a sense, they will send you the money and how will you deal with it? You deal with it. So, but I got a question for you. If it's not a problem, of course. What kind of tax bracket are you guys in? Pretend to drive. What's your tax bracket? I think it's $0.55% for some tax bracket. Are you about for? No, I don't think about for what you know. So, yeah, so I mean, and that's for the first, for this amount, you're not supposed to pay taxes, what we get back now, because that's what we, in total invested, right? So, in terms of income, our current income, there's no taxes to pay. Maybe a little bit, a little bit over, but you know what I mean, right? The $60,000 is US dollars. It's about equal what we sent. So, when we take that out, there shouldn't be any taxes for us. Yes, that is correct. Do I have. That's the security calculator. The amount of money gets transferred. Sorry, the amount of money that you withdrawing, the minus the amount of money that you transfer.

Sorry about that. Oh really?\\n28.2 I don't have a sword now.\\n30.2 I got the chalacious now.\\n32.2 Okay. Well, at least we got each other right here right now. Listen, you're dead. As I was told by my finance team, they looked into this.\\n41.2 Now, I personally do with atomic, but I should be honest, I never cashed out. I stocked by a monster all in atomic.\\n48.2 Can I remove anything out of atomic? Right? Let's put a disc lane. So my knowledge, personal knowledge, maybe limited.\\n55.2 But I'm checking everything up with my finance team and they're telling me that the taxes are included in this money.\\n63.2 So the taxes are included in this particular amount of cash that they're asking of you.\\n69.2 Now, how are they planning to refund it? I have no idea. Right? That's something that I must not explain.\\n75.2 But the money that is supposed to be coming in, who your account and most likely the next step will be to ask you for the payment details, I suppose.\\n84.2 Like where is the money going to be sending to? The money will be coming in from an account that is not related to crypto.\\n91.2 That is the reason how they justify. And they say, that's how you don't pay taxes after the money comes in to your account.\\n98.2 You understand? Because the transfer has nothing to do with crypto currency. The cash health itself, if you understand what I mean.\\n105.2 Yeah, so what I don't understand, Benjamin, is what we are doing. Well, personal, my next question is, is the envy transfer back to index as we planned? Like it says?\\n116.2 Yes. And then convert it. Well, this is something that has to be done with atomic support.\\n124.2 I suppose it is possible. I've seen a reason why it wouldn't be possible. But if you can shoot them, I'm not interested in having this transferred to the dollar.\\n133.2 Canadian, I'm going to transfer it over to index by myself. But whether that's possible, like you already read it. So that kind of a message.\\n143.2 Yes, they are. Because of in terms of taxes, when you get it back to index, when you do it on our account, you put it in a special account.\\n154.2 And you must say, whatever we have invested, we don't have to pay taxes.\\n158.2 Wait, wait, wait, wait. Just to correct you over there. Okay? Any money coming in, the dollar can aid in, from index, right? In fact, there is no debate about it.\\n170.2 Okay, the question is from what type of account or from what business is the money coming in? And then that being one of Canada's largest cryptocurrency case here, that money will be taxable at some point.\\n182.2 Do you understand? Yes, it will be okay. 100%. There is no debate about it. Why do we even $100? It's taxable. Do you understand?\\n195.2 Okay, there is no debate about it. And given that you have, that you're withdrawing, reported what you've invested, right, you will have taxes. There is no question about it.\\n205.2 Now, what atomic as I was explained over here about my finances, what atomic is offering, I mean, it's not clearly explained. So let's put it this way. I have to give you a disclaimer. It's a speculation, right? A very educated speculation, let's put it this way.\\n219.2 It can be clarified very much, I guess, in a future couple of messages. But one of my guess is that it's going to be a Canada transfer from their account to your account.\\n230.2 Their account that they will use will not have any kind of relations to cryptocurrency whatsoever. There goes the transfer that they're doing to you will be not taxable.\\n242.2 Now, how are they going to justify giving you this feedback? I have no idea, to be honest. This is not what they might need to understand. I really don't clarify because in the free show that they're sending, they mention that it is responsible.\\n260.2 Yeah, and if it's taxes, so that must be a Canadian company then they're right because they don't know. It is a Canadian company, no. At atomic, atomic. Where is what's founded is the Italian isponina.\\n273.2 So, atomic is coming from a Baltic country. I don't know if you've ever heard about it, Estonia. You probably did, right? Yeah. So it's a Baltic country.\\n283.2 Obviously, atomic having dead borders in Italian isponina, a compliance with the European Union financial laws and regulations. So, I mean, I don't know if that applies to their breads.\\n295.2 Canada, very much. I'm not quite sure about it. I really don't know. But I'm guessing that there are some rules and regulations. Let's put it this way.\\n303.2 I have had my clients withdraw a lot of money from us. Some of these clients have passed out their accounts and we haven't spoken about it afterwards. Some of them have some money left because it's continued working. Nobody has ever been complaining.\\n319.2 Nobody, nobody has ever had any sort of situation in which they haven't gotten their money. As I mentioned, atomic wallet as a crypto company is way larger than ours. I mean, facilitating a couple of hundreds of thousands dollar withdrawal will probably even have a few million dollars is a piece of cake for them. The way I see it.\\n337.2 Crypto transactions are public. So, let's say, for example, when my client puts the money in atomic and like, today, you use it for staking. Staking is investing. Your cryptocurrency for a certain period of time. It's called staking.\\n350.2 When they do that, their money goes into some atomic wallet facilities, meaning their own wallets. These wallets are of course possible to be checked to see the balances and what kind of amount of money is moved over there.\\n363.2 I can tell you it's a decade volume. It's about $650 million on a 24-hour basis. They're massive. They're super big.\\n375.2 So, from that kind of a perspective on the information that I can gather at what I've seen with my own eyes, I can kind of personally vouch atomic solidagem at these and of course, their facilities which are unprecedented.\\n389.2 Now, how are you going to guys approach this? Of course, I need to use, of course. Let's put it this way. You might what you're thinking, what do I think? If you can skip the middle moment, which in this case would be the end act.\\n404.2 And get your mind straight into a can of the bank account. I take it. And not to mention that there is on everything you get attached to. It's the most beautiful deal you could wish for in my opinion. I mean, I said, you will approach this or where will you see it? But, you know, it would be my kind of personal input.\\n423.2 I'm thinking with you now, not in the capacity as an account manager. This would be like, I'm in Geneva, Switzerland simply because I don't want to pay government, you know, 40% of my money.\\n435.2 So, you know, I may have a little bit of a bias competing on taxes. I'm not kind of like a boy scout, a good guy when he comes to taxes. I will take advantage of every sport that I can get my hand on.\\n449.2 I'm thinking because I consider this to be a, I should say, a kind of a little bit of a TV. But that's a thing. Let's put it this way. I don't want to impose my will on you. That's my opinion.\\n461.2 Yeah. So, it comes to taxes and expenses of moving money or cashing out my investments. And I'm coming from your head of state. You know, in there, they would see you alive. And God forbid you get sick here. You're done for. You can basically go bankrupt, you know.\\n477.2 And so, I don't know, I have a certain perspective on the matter. And I'm okay to share that as perspective. But of course, like I said, I don't expect you to have my perspective.\\n487.2 So, Benjamin, would it hurt to ask him if we can go and send it forward to Maddox and the money would be enough? And I mean, the money would be enough if we put in there.\\n499.2 Yeah, of course. That was my original suggestion. The bad thing to be, of course, to treat them a message and tell them, would it be possible to get it done like this.\\n509.2 But if we couldn't have you a problem, I mean, and then you send me a free flow later on, if you can ask another side question or two regarding how do they plan to justify this fee return? And whether that fee includes taxes as well.\\n525.2 But you don't have to if you don't want to. Yeah, no, no, no, good points. No, no, good points. Yeah. Because if it does, then you've got yourself the best deal there is.\\n537.2 So, in other words, what you're saying that extra fee, you're almost $27,000 would be including income tax. Canadian income tax, is that what you're saying?\\n547.2 So, if you're paying income tax, capital gains tax, capital would have income tax only if you are licensed and registered day traders. Meaning you do this for a living.\\n557.2 Yeah, what's that? Capital gains tax does not mean, it's only some dishes to watch you guys are new. You guys are not day traders. That's important for emphasize. So, day traders will have income tax, right?\\n569.2 Because this is their job. This is their profession. This is what they do for a living. Capital gains tax is a simple sale of de-office. You understand?\\n578.2 CLA does not have any sort of information what you do with your fading account with all real growth. You understand? There is no information about it.\\n586.2 They only see transfer the certain amount of crypto and that you've got tax of certain amount of crypto. Which is initially, let's say for example, like you did without that, right?\\n597.2 You've got a certain amount of Bitcoin, you transferred it over to some wallet. They don't know what China conversion has to be done. Did you buy Bitcoin? Bitcoin cash, Ethereum? Did you buy Clonna? Did you buy Cardano? Did you buy some altcoins that is like, way below one cent?\\n614.2 Because people do that all the time. But it's just for me to clarify probably a tonics perspective. In a tonics you notice hundreds, it's probably not thousands of coins available over there.\\n626.2 Make sure you have coins on a tonics are way below a set. Which means let's say for about a thousand dollars, you would get let's say 25 million or even 25 billion of these coins.\\n639.2 And if you move one of them, right? Lives as to let's say half a dollar or a dollar, people will end up making for a thousand bucks. Probably a couple of hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars.\\n650.2 Now, of course, this is borderline gambling. But when we're talking about tax limitation of expenses and especially in crypto, this is how you justify it. Especially when we're doing crypto trading.\\n663.2 There's no capital or pensioners on the spender for me. So if there's a capital that tax, we're going to ask them, I think. But that will be copies of gaining taxes and then who will do it? Yes, yes, yes, yes.\\n675.2 Who would keep the company? No, no. What is it? As for the message that they've sent, you would get that back. I mean, I am testing that they would take some money out of the transportation of the transfer.\\n691.2 These things usually go without saying, but if you can get away with, I don't know, let's say $69,000 in America plus the 20s, whatever they're asking in Canada dollars, I'm not quite sure.\\n706.2 But let's say it all rounds up to what? About $160,000 in 18 years. And let's say you get back $110,000, I would feel sensitive to be on an amazing deal.\\n720.2 So in order to break you down, ask them for the option of transferring your taxes to a transaction that you do everything on your own and you're handling everything on your own, even when taxes come into place.\\n733.2 And then enter a transaction and an index, they don't charge that extra fee or you don't know.\\n738.2 You have a fee? You have a fee? Yes, they're not.\\n740.2 You have a fee. You have a fee for the transfer, but they are not dealing with taxes.\\n745.2 They have a sense, they will send you the money and how will you deal with it? You deal with it.\\n750.2 So, but I got a question for you. If it's not a problem, of course. What kind of tax bracket are you guys in? Pretend to drive.\\n758.2 What's your tax bracket? I think it's $0.55% for some tax bracket.\\n763.2 Are you about for?\\n765.2 No, I don't think about for what you know.\\n770.2 So, yeah, so I mean, and that's for the first, for this amount, you're not supposed to pay taxes, what we get back now, because that's what we, in total invested, right?\\n781.2 So, in terms of income, our current income, there's no taxes to pay. Maybe a little bit, a little bit over, but you know what I mean, right?\\n789.2 The $60,000 is US dollars. It's about equal what we sent. So, when we take that out, there shouldn't be any taxes for us.\\n801.2 Yes, that is correct. Do I have. That's the security calculator. The amount of money gets transferred.\\n808.2 Sorry, the amount of money that you withdrawing, the minus the amount of money that you transfer. And that amount of money that you've, that is the difference, the subject, the subject, the subject of all taxes.\\n819.2 Okay, let's do some of check everything with them. Double check everything with them. She's in the message as soon as they reply. Send me a free shot and I'll get back with you. That's okay.\\n829.2 Good. Thanks so much.\\n831.2 No problem.

That's something that I was not explaining.\\r\\n00:01:16\\r\\nBut the money that is supposed to be coming in to your account and most likely, the next step will be to ask you for the payment details, I suppose. Like, where is the money going to be sent into? The money will be coming in from an account that is not related to crypto. Hence, that is the reason how they justify it. You understand?\\r\\n00:01:35\\r\\nThat's how you don't pay taxes after the money comes into your account. You understand? Because the transfer has nothing to do with cryptocurrency. The cash out itself, if you understand what I mean.\\r\\n00:01:46\\r\\nYeah. So what I don't understand, Benjamin, is what we are told well, first of all, my next question is is can we transfer it back to index as we planned? Like, is\\r\\n00:01:57\\r\\nthat Yeah.\\r\\n00:01:57\\r\\nAnd then convert it?\\r\\n00:02:00\\r\\nWell, this is something that has to be done with with atomic support. I suppose it is possible. I see no reason why it wouldn't be possible. But if you can shoot them a message, tell them I'm not interested in having it transferred in dollar Canadian. I'm gonna transfer it over to EdEx by myself and whether that's possible.\\r\\n00:02:21\\r\\nLet me know what is needed. So that kind of a message. Yeah. Sure. Why\\r\\n00:02:25\\r\\nnot? Are they because of in terms of taxes, when we get it back to index and do it on our account, we put it in a special account. And for the you know, for whatever we have invested, we don't have to pay taxes.\\r\\n00:02:39\\r\\nOh, you're right. Wait. Wait. Wait. Just just to correct you over there.\\r\\n00:02:43\\r\\nOkay? Any money coming in the dollar Canadian trauma tax, right, is taxable. There is no debate about it.\\r\\n00:02:50\\r\\nOkay. It\\r\\n00:02:51\\r\\nis the question is from what type of account or from what business is the money coming in? And then that being one of Canada's largest cryptocurrency exchangers Yep. That money will be taxable at some point. Do you understand?\\r\\n00:03:04\\r\\nOh, yeah. Y'all yes. It will be? Okay.\\r\\n00:03:08\\r\\nHundred percent. There is no debate about it. Whether it's even a hundred dollars, it's it's taxable. You understand? Mhmm.\\r\\n00:03:15\\r\\nOkay.\\r\\n00:03:15\\r\\nThere is no debate about it. And given that you have that you're withdrawing more than what you've invested, right, you will have taxes. There is no question about it. Now what Atomic as I was explained over here about my finances, what Atomic is offering I mean, it's not clearly explained. So let's put it this way.\\r\\n00:03:34\\r\\nI have to give you a disclaimer. It's speculation. Right? A very educated speculation, let's put it this way. It can be clarified very much, I guess, in a future couple of messages.\\r\\n00:03:44\\r\\nBut what am I guessing is that it's going to be a Canada transfer from your their account to your account. That account that they will use will not have any kind of relations to cryptocurrency whatsoever. Ergo, the the the transfer that they are doing to you will be not taxable. Now how are they going to justify giving you these fees back? I have no idea, to be honest.\\r\\n00:04:09\\r\\nThis is not within my needs to understand. I I I I I really don't clarify because in the screenshot that you sent me, they mentioned that it is refundable. Yes.\\r\\n00:04:27\\r\\nomplies with the European Union financial laws and regulations. So, I mean, I don't know if that applies to their branch in Canada very much. I'm not quite sure about it.\\r\\n00:04:58\\r\\nI really don't know. But I'm guessing that there are some rules and regulations. I mean, let's put it this way. I have had my clients withdrawn a a lot of money to our company. And some of these clients have, you know, cash out their entire accounts, and we haven't spoken about it afterwards.\\r\\n00:05:14\\r\\nSome of them had some money left with us and continue working. Nobody has ever been complaining. Nobody. Nobody ever had any sort of situation in which they haven't gotten their money. Not to mention that Atomic Wallet as a crypto company is way larger than us.\\r\\n00:05:29\\r\\nI mean, facilitating a couple of hundred thousand dollar withdrawal or probably even a few million dollars is a piece of cake for them. The way I see it, you know, crypto transactions are public. So let's say, for example, when my clients put the money in Atomic and right today, you use it for staking. Staking is investing your cryptocurrency for a certain period of time. It's called staking.\\r\\n00:05:51\\r\\nSo when they do that, their money goes into some Atomic Wallet facilities, meaning their own wallets. These wallets are, of course, possible to be checked to see the balances and what kind of amount of money is moved over there. And I can tell you it's the the trading volume is about, you know, six six hundred and fifty million dollars on a twenty four hour basis. They're massive. They're massive.\\r\\n00:06:14\\r\\nThey're super big. So from that kind of a perspective on the information that I can gather is what I've seen with my own eyes, I can kind of personally vouch Atomic's legitimacy\\r\\nand, of course, there are facilities which are unprecedented. Now how are you going to guys approach this, sir? Of course, sir. I I leave it to you, of course.\\r\\n00:06:36\\r\\nBut let's put it this way. In my way of thinking, what do I think, if you can skip the middleman, which in this case would be the Amdex, and get your money straight into a Canada Bank account, I take it. And not to mention that they refund everything, you get it tax free. It's it's the most beautiful deal you could wish for, in my opinion. I mean, I I as I said, you will approach this however you see that, but\\r\\n00:07:01\\r\\nYeah. I got it.\\r\\n00:07:02\\r\\nThat would be my kind of personal input. I'm speaking with you now, not in the capacity as an account manager.\\r\\n00:07:07\\r\\nI agree.\\r\\n00:07:07\\r\\nThis would be like, I I'm in Geneva, Switzerland simply because I don't wanna pay\\r\\ngovernment, you know, forty percent of my money. So, you know, I may may have a little bit of a unbiased opinion on taxes. I I I'm not kind of like a boy scout, a good guy when it comes to taxes. I will take advantage of every report that I can get my hands on Yeah. Simply because I consider this to be a how should I say?\\r\\n00:07:33\\r\\nA kind of a little bit of a thieving gift, but but that's opinion. Right? Let's put it this way. I don't want to impose my will on you. That's my opinion.\\r\\n00:07:41\\r\\nYeah. So when it comes to taxes and expenses of moving money or cashing out my investments and I'm coming from the United States. You know? In in in there, they would skin you alive. I mean, god forbid, you get sick.\\r\\n00:07:54\\r\\nYou're you're done for. You can basically go bankrupt. You know? And so I don't know. I have a certain perspective on on the on the matter, and I'm okay to share that perspective.\\r\\n00:08:05\\r\\nBut, of course, like I said, I don't expect you to have my perspective.\\r\\n00:08:08\\r\\nSo, Benjamin, would it hurt to ask them if we can go and send it forward to Nordex? Then the money would be enough. And that's I mean, money would be enough what we put in there.\\r\\n00:08:20\\r\\nYes. Of course. That was my original suggestion. The best thing would be, of course, to shoot them a message and tell them would it be possible to get it done like this. But if would not be a problem, I mean, you can send me a screenshot later on.\\r\\n00:08:34\\r\\nIf you can ask another side question or two regarding how do they plan to justify this fee being returned and whether that fee includes taxes as well, taxation. Yeah. But you don't have to if you don't want to.\\r\\n00:08:49\\r\\nThat's Yeah. No. No. Good point. No.\\r\\n00:08:51\\r\\nNo. That's Yeah.\\r\\n00:08:53\\r\\nBecause if it does, then you got yourself the best deal there is, obviously. So so in other words, what you're saying, that extra fee of almost twenty seven thousand dollars would be including income tax, Canadian income tax. Is that what you're saying? Not income tax. Capital gains tax.\\r\\n00:09:10\\r\\nCapital You would have income tax only if you are licensed and registered day traders. Meaning, you do this for a living. You understand? Capital gains tax does not it's only subjected to what you guys are doing. You guys are not day traders.\\r\\n00:09:24\\r\\nRight. That's important to emphasize. So day traders will have income tax, right, simply because this is their job. This is their profession. This is what they do for a living.\\r\\n00:09:35\\r\\nCapital gains tax is a simple sale of the asset. You understand? CRA does not have any sort of information what you do with your trading account with All Real Group. You understand? That that there is no information about it.\\r\\n00:09:47\\r\\nThey only see that you've transferred a certain amount of crypto and that you've got back a certain amount of crypto. Okay. Which is initially, let's say, for example, like you did with that debt. Right? You bought a certain amount of Bitcoin.\\r\\n00:10:00\\r\\nYou transferred it over to some wallet. You don't they don't know what kind of conversion has it been done. Did you buy Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum? Did you buy Solana? Did you buy Cardano?\\r\\n00:10:10\\r\\nDid you buy some Altcoin that is, let's say, way below one cent? Because people do that all the time. Let me just for me to clarify, probably, Atomic's perspective. In Atomic, you've noticed hundreds, if probably not thousands of coins available over there. Majority of coins on Atomic are way below a set, which means, let's say, for about a\\r\\nthousand dollars, you would get, let's say, twenty five million or even twenty five billion of these coins.\\r\\n00:10:40\\r\\nAnd if even one of them, right, rises to, let's say, half a dollar or a dollar, people will end up making from a thousand bucks, probably a couple of hundred thousands or millions of dollars. Now, of course, this is borderline gambling. But when we're talking about tax limitation of expenses and especially in crypto, this is how you justify it, especially we're doing crypto trading.\\r\\n00:11:05\\r\\nYeah. So capital Benjamin, I understand that for me. So if there's a cap that tax, we we gonna ask them, I think. But Mhmm. That will be capital gain taxes and then who\\r\\n00:11:14\\r\\nwould Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Capital gain tax.\\r\\n00:11:16\\r\\nWho would keep that? Like, the company?\\r\\n00:11:21\\r\\nNo. Well, listen. As for the message that they've sent, you would get that back. I mean, am guessing that they would take some money out Oh, that's funny. Facilitation of the transfer.\\r\\n00:11:32\\r\\nRight? These things usually go without paying. But if you can get away with I don't know. Let's say sixty nine thousand dollars American plus the twenty whatever they're asking in Canada dollars. I'm not quite sure.\\r\\n00:11:47\\r\\nBut let's say let's say it all rounds up what? About a hundred and fifteen, sixty thousand dollars Canadian? And let's say you get back hundred and ten, I would still consider this to be an amazing deal. So in order to break it down, right, ask them for the option of transferring it just to a tax that they you do everything on your own, and you're handling everything on your own, right, even when taxes come into play.\\r\\n00:12:13\\r\\nAnd then Benjamin, in index, they don't charge that extra fee or you don't know a fee. You have a fee. Yeah. There's\\r\\n00:12:21\\r\\nYou have a fee. You have a fee for the transfer, but they are not dealing with taxes. You understand? They will send you the money, and however you deal with it, you deal with it. So but but I got a question for you, if it's not a problem, of course.\\r\\n00:12:35\\r\\nWhat kind of tax bracket are you guys in percentage wise? What's your\\r\\n00:12:39\\r\\ntax bracket? I think it's thirty five percent, I think.\\r\\n00:12:44\\r\\nAre you above forty?\\r\\n00:12:45\\r\\nNo. I don't think above forty. No. No. So yeah.\\r\\n00:12:51\\r\\nSo I mean and then for the first for this amount, we are not supposed to pay taxes once we get back now because that's what we, in total, invested roughly. Right? What we sent there. So from in terms of income, our accountant, there's no taxes to pay. Maybe a little bit.\\r\\n00:13:08\\r\\nThey're a little bit over, but you know what I mean. Right? The sixty five thousand US dollars, it's about equal what we sent. So when we take that out, there shouldn't be any taxes for us. Yes.\\r\\n00:13:22\\r\\nThat is correct, dear. Taxes should be calculated the amount of money that you transferred. Sorry. The amount of money that you're withdrawing minus the amount of\\r\\nmoney that you transferred, and that amount of money that you've that is the difference subject subjectible tax.\\r\\n00:13:37\\r\\nRight. Okay. Yeah.\\r\\n00:13:41\\r\\nBut please double check everything with them. Double check everything with them. Shoot them a message as soon as they reply. Send me a screenshot, and I'll and I'll get back with you. That's okay.\\r\\n00:13:49\\r\\nGood. Thanks so much.\\r\\n00:13:51\\r\\nNo problem. K. You're welcome. Okay. Bye, Juergen.\\r\\n00:13:54\\r\\nBye, Rachel.\"}, {'id': 'a194ed36-6886-43b7-b31d-f23d1fa3ac83', 'call_id': 'a99d02da-81a0-4032-8e63-9e399a102ce8', 'transcript_text': \" Hello. Hello.
